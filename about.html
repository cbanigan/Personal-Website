                I am a junior undergraduate student at Texas A&amp;M University pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science with minors
                in both Art and Mathematics. My passion has been computers ever since I was little, and I am currently pursuing a career in software engineering. Throughout
                my life, I have been fascinated by creative arts, whether that be art, music, or even design. Great design strikes a chord with me,
                and I hope to be able to incorporate solid design choices throughout my professional work.

                Howdy! My name is Colin Banigan, and I grew up as a homeschooled military brat. Although I am here in Texas now, I have moved around 15 times during my life, as my father is a retired Captain from the US Navy. As such, I have lived in many areas across the country, including Tennessee, Virginia, and Hawaii. My personal favorite location that I've lived was easily Honolulu, Hawaii, where I lived only 5 minutes away from the USS Arizona memorial.

                I am an undergraduate student at Texas A&amp;M University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. As I also enjoy creative arts as well as problem solving, I am also pursuing minors in both Visualization as well as Mathematics. Currently, I am not involved in any clubs, but I am involved heavily within the HCI@Viz research lab where I develop Android Wear applications for informal educational science learning for elementary schoolchildren. I am ambitious to pursue higher education in Computer Science, specifically with interests in Human-Computer Interaction as well as Computer Graphics.

                In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, practicing my guitar, and playing multiplayer video games. For guitar, I've been playing since the beginning of high school. I play both acoustic and electric, but I prefer playing my acoustic guitar. When I have time to play games, I prefer to play multiplayer competitive games such as League of Legends and Overwatch.
